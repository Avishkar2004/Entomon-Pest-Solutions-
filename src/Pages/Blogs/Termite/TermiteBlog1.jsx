                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                        Formosan termites (Coptotermes formosanus) are a type of subterranean termite known for their large colonies and aggressive behavior. A single colony can contain millions of termites and extend up to 300 feet in the ground. These termites build extensive underground tunnels, making them challenging to detect and eliminate.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Before you start treatment, confirm the presence of Formosan termites by looking for these signs:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4 space-y-3">
                        <li><span className="font-bold">Mud Tubes:</span> Pencil-sized tubes made of soil and saliva, used for travel between the nest and food sources.</li>
                        <li><span className="font-bold">Swarmers:</span> Winged termites that emerge in large numbers, especially in the spring.</li>
                        <li><span className="font-bold">Damaged Wood:</span> Wood that sounds hollow when tapped and exhibits a honeycomb pattern inside.</li>
                        <li><span className="font-bold">Frass:</span> Tiny, pellet-shaped droppings found near infested wood.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4 space-y-3">
                        <li><FaTools className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Professional Inspection:</span> Engage a licensed pest control professional to conduct a thorough inspection of your property. They can accurately identify the extent of the infestation and recommend the best treatment options.</li>
                        <li><FaShieldAlt className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Soil Treatments:</span> Apply liquid termiticides to the soil around your home. This creates a chemical barrier that kills termites upon contact. Popular termiticides include fipronil and imidacloprid.</li>
                        <li><FaBug className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Bait Stations:</span> Install bait stations around your property. These contain a slow-acting poison that worker termites carry back to the colony, eventually killing the queen and the entire colony.</li>
                        <li><FaShieldAlt className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Wood Treatments:</span> Treat infested wood with borate solutions. Borates are toxic to termites and can help eliminate existing colonies while preventing future infestations.</li>
                        <li><FaTools className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Fumigation:</span> For severe infestations, consider fumigation. This involves sealing the structure and filling it with a gas that kills termites. Fumigation is highly effective but requires you to vacate the premises for a few days.</li>
                        <li><FaTint className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Moisture Control:</span> Formosan termites thrive in moist environments. Fix any leaks in your home, ensure proper drainage, and use dehumidifiers in damp areas to make your home less attractive to termites.</li>

                        <li><FaTools className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Regular Inspections:</span> Schedule annual inspections with a pest control professional to catch any signs of termite activity early.</li>
                        <li><FaShieldAlt className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Reduce Wood Contact:</span> Keep firewood, lumber, and other wooden materials away from your home’s foundation. Use concrete or metal barriers where wood meets the soil.</li>
                        <li><FaBug className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Seal Cracks:</span> Seal cracks and crevices in your home’s foundation and walls to prevent termites from entering.</li>
                        <li><FaTint className="inline mr-2 text-blue-600" /><span className="font-bold">Landscape Management:</span> Maintain a gap between soil and wooden structures. Avoid planting trees and shrubs too close to your home, as their roots can create pathways for termites.</li>
