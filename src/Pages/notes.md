              Termites are wood-eating insects that are often confused with
              ants. They are more closely related to cockroaches. Termites are
              also called wood bugs because they have destroyed structures and

            </span>
            <br></br>
            They survive mostly in warm and humid temperatures. They can break
            down wood into smaller substances, making it easier for them to chew
            and digest. They can get into your home through a crack no bigger
            than the width of a penny. They eat 24 hours a day. They can coexist
            with other colonies, but if one goes into the other's premises, it
            will be immediately killed and removed. The only kind of termite
            that has wings is the reproductive swarmer.

            Cockroaches are nocturnal creatures and tend to hide during the day.
            If you notice live cockroaches scurrying around at night or find
            small dark droppings resembling coffee grounds, it could indicate an
            infestation.

          <p class="mb-4 sm:text-base">
            <span class="font-semibold">Unpleasant odor: </span>
            Cockroaches emit a distinctive musty odor that can become noticeable
            in areas with a large population. If you detect an unpleasant smell,
            particularly in kitchen or bathroom areas, it could be a sign of a
            cockroach infestation.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 sm:text-base">
            Dealing with a cockroach infestation requires professional
            expertise. A licensed pest control company can assess the severity
            of the infestation and implement appropriate cockroach control
            measures. This may include insecticide treatments, baits, and
            sealing entry points to prevent further infestations.

            <li>
              They prefer to avoid exposure to light and maintain a hidden

            <li>
              These resilient insects can establish their hiding spots in

              Cockroaches can travel and infest new areas by navigating through
              gaps and openings, and they are also known to be carried in
              infested items such as bags, boxes, and furniture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Travel and Infestation: cockroachs have the ability to infest new
              areas through soil traversal, utilizing mud tubes, or by being
              transported within infested wood, furniture, or other
              cellulose-based materials.

              Remember, if you suspect a cockroach infestation in your property,

            <span class="font-semibold">Breeding grounds: </span>
            Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water, so eliminating
            potential breeding sites is essential. Regularly check and empty
            containers like flowerpots, bird baths, and clogged gutters where
            stagnant water can accumulate.

            <span class="font-semibold">HBites and buzzing sounds: </span>
            Mosquitoes are known for their itchy bites. If you notice an
            increase in mosquito bites, especially during peak mosquito activity
            times (dawn and dusk), it may indicate a higher mosquito population.
            Additionally, the buzzing sound of female mosquitoes is a common
            sign of their presence.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 sm:text-base">
            <span class="font-semibold"> Preventive measures:</span>
            Use screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out of your
            home. Consider using mosquito nets while sleeping, wearing long
            sleeves and pants, and using insect repellent to protect yourself
            from bites.

            <span class="font-semibold">Professional mosquito control:</span>
            If mosquito infestations are severe, professional pest control
            services can help. Mosquito control methods may include the use of
            insecticides, larvicides, and fogging to reduce adult mosquito
            populations.

            </li>
            <li>
              Breeding Sites: Mosquitoes breed in standing water, laying their
              eggs on the water's surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              Attracted to Odors: Mosquitoes are attracted to body heat, carbon
              dioxide, and body odors when seeking hosts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prevention: Measures to prevent mosquito bites include using
              repellents, wearing protective clothing, and using bed nets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Day and Night Activity: Mosquitoes are most active during dawn and
