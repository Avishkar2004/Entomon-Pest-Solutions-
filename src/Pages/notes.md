              Pest control companies have the advantage of using chemicals and
              other treatments that are not available to you. They have
              insecticides that both kill bugs on contact and that stay inside
              furniture and cracks to kill bedbugs in the long term.

              Pest control companies can also use whole room heat treatments.
              They bring in special equipment that heats up the room to a
              temperature between 135 and 145°F (57.22 and 62.78°C) — high
              enough to kill bedbugs.

              Before the pest control company arrives, they should give you
              instructions for prepping your home. Follow their directions
              carefully and you’ll have the best chance of wiping out the bugs.
            </p>

              Professional treatments take two to three visits to start working.
              After each treatment, you may have to stay out of the treated
              rooms for a few hours until the insecticides have dried.
